#[[[ Parses a timestamp and returns the parts.
#
# This function encapsulates the process of parsing a timestamp and separating
# it into days, hours, minutes and seconds. It is assumed that the format of the
# timestamp is ``w:x:y:z`` where:
#
# - ``w`` is the day of the year as a three digit integer [1,366]
# - ``x`` is the hour on a 24-hour clock as a two digit integer [00, 23]
# - ``y`` is the minute of the current hour as a two digit integer [00, 59]
# - ``z`` is the second of the current minute as a two digit integer [00, 59]
#
# If the timestamp provided to this function has an incorrect format an error
# will be raised.
#
# :param _ctps_d: An identifier to hold ``w``.
# :type _ctps_d: identifier
# :param _ctps_h: An identifier to hold ``x``.
